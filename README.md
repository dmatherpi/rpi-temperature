# rpi-temperature
Local temperature measurement, display and recording with Raspberry Pi

Since 2011 I have undertaken a hobby project to create a hardware and software stack to achieve the following aims:
a) Measure the local temperature
b) Record the local temperature
c) Display a local 'frost warning' low temperature indicator
d) Display the local temperature online
e) Display the local temperature on a dedicated display at home
f) Undertake anaylsis of the local temperature, such as to identify heat waves or cold snaps

This project has taken many forms over a number of years and has existed in it's current form since 2020.
Since 2020 I have had a two sites operational with hourly recording of temperature data.
Data is published to: https://dmather.com/weather

This project has benefitted from other people's open source code and the sharing of ideas and it is now time to give back. Throught this pubic repository I aim to share each component of this project in a replicatable format.

Comments welcome.
