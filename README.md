# rpi-temperature
Local temperature measurement, display and recording with Raspberry Pi

Since 2011 I have undertaken a hobby project to create a hardware and software stack to measure, record and display the local temperature using a Raspberry Pi.

See the Wiki for full details of the project and it's aims and objectives: https://github.com/dmatherpi/rpi-temperature/wiki

This project has benefitted from other people's open source code and the sharing of ideas and it is now time to give back. Throught this pubic repository I aim to share each component of this project in a replicatable format.
